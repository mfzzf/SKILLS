# SKILLS

A curated index of Claude / Cursor / Codex compatible skills I maintain. Each entry is a standalone repo and is wired in here as a git submodule, so a single `git clone --recursive` pulls every skill at the pinned commit.

> Maintaining this catalog? See **[MAINTENANCE.md](./MAINTENANCE.md)** and run `make help`.

---

## Install on a new machine

End-to-end: clone the catalog, then symlink every skill into both Claude Code and Codex so updates are realtime (no copy step).

### 0. Prereqs

- `git` ≥ 2.30
- `make`
- `gh` CLI (optional, only needed if you'll publish from this machine)
- SSH key registered with GitHub *or* HTTPS auth working — pick one and stay consistent

Sanity check:

```bash
git --version && make --version | head -1 && ssh -T git@github.com 2>&1 | head -1
```

### 1. Pick a home and clone

Put the catalog somewhere persistent (NOT inside a project you might delete). Example:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/code && cd ~/code
git clone --recursive git@github.com:mfzzf/SKILLS.git
cd SKILLS
```

If you forgot `--recursive`, run `make init` — it's idempotent.

If you prefer HTTPS:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mfzzf/SKILLS.git
```

### 2. Verify the catalog landed cleanly

```bash
make status        # each skill should show "behind: 0"
make check         # every submodule should also appear in this README
```

### 3. Wire it into Claude Code and Codex

```bash
make link
```

This creates symlinks:

- `~/.claude/skills/<name>` → catalog
- `~/.codex/skills/<name>`  → catalog
- Bundle skills (`anthropics-skills/skills/*`) are auto-expanded so each shows up as its own top-level entry (`frontend-design`, `skill-creator`, `claude-api`, …).

Conflict handling:

- An existing **symlink** with the same name is updated in place.
- An existing **real directory** is left alone and printed as a warning — move it aside (`mv foo foo.bak`) if you want the catalog version to take over.

Verify:

```bash
make link-status
```

Every catalog entry should appear as `↪ <name> -> ...  [catalog]` under both roots.

### 4. Restart your clients

- **Claude Code**: restart the CLI / VS Code extension so it rescans `~/.claude/skills/`.
- **Codex**: restart the Codex CLI / session.

Then ask the agent something that should trigger one of the skills (e.g. *"scaffold a Next.js app"* → should pick up `frontend-build-2026`).

### 5. Stay current — daily ops

```bash
cd ~/code/SKILLS

make sync          # pull catalog + move submodules to pinned commits
make bump-all      # advance every submodule to its upstream HEAD (then push)
make push          # publish bumped pins
make link          # safe to rerun; picks up newly added bundle members
```

Optional shell alias:

```bash
echo "alias skills-up='cd ~/code/SKILLS && make sync && make bump-all && make push && make link'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### 6. Uninstall

```bash
cd ~/code/SKILLS
make unlink        # removes only the symlinks this catalog created
# then optionally:
cd .. && rm -rf SKILLS
```

`make unlink` is conservative: it ignores external symlinks (e.g. `~/.agents/skills/...`) and real directories. Nothing outside the catalog is touched.

## Quick clone (if you already know the drill)

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:mfzzf/SKILLS.git
cd SKILLS && make link
```

### [modelverse-image](./modelverse-image) &nbsp;·&nbsp; [source](https://github.com/mfzzf/modelverse-image)

Generate or edit raster images through the **ModelVerse OpenAI-compatible `gpt-image-2` API**. Use when an agent (Codex / Claude) needs to create images from prompts, edit an existing image with an optional mask, save returned base64 data to local files, or surface curl/Python examples.

**Triggers**: "generate an image", "image edit with mask", "gpt-image-2", "ModelVerse image API", "save b64_json to file".

**What's inside**: `scripts/modelverse_image.py` with `generate` and `edit` subcommands, an OpenAI-compatible agent spec, and an `references/api.md` covering auth, endpoints, and response shape.

---

### [ucloud-api](./ucloud-api) &nbsp;·&nbsp; [source](https://github.com/mfzzf/ucloud-skills)

Call any **UCloud OpenAPI** (UAI / ModelVerse / UMInfer / UHost / VPC / …) with correct SHA1 signing. Bundles a Python helper that handles param sorting, encoding edge cases (bool, float), VPC vs public endpoints, env-var creds, dry-run, and a `--selftest` against UCloud's published verification sample.

**Triggers**: any UCloud Action name (`List*`, `Describe*`, `Get*`, `Create*`, `Delete*`, `Modify*` against `api.ucloud.cn`), "UCloud signature", "UCloud PublicKey PrivateKey", "ListUMInferAPIKey", "GetProjectList", "调用 UCloud 接口", "UCloud 签名".

**What's inside**: `scripts/ucloud_call.py` (CLI + library) with selftest, `references/signing.md` (canonical algorithm walkthrough with verification sample), and a growing `references/apis/` recipe book (`list-um-infer-apikey.md`, `get-project-list.md`, …). Add a recipe whenever you call a new Action.

---

### [modelverse-api](./modelverse-api) &nbsp;·&nbsp; [source](https://github.com/mfzzf/modelverse-skills)

Data-plane caller for **UCloud ModelVerse / UModelVerse** — invoke any hosted model (DeepSeek, Qwen, GPT-5, gpt-image-2, Sora-2, Veo-3.1, Kling, Wan-2.x, MiniMax-Hailuo, Suno, Gemini / Claude compatible, embeddings, rerank, …) over OpenAI-compatible endpoints (`api.modelverse.cn` / `api.umodelverse.ai`). Pairs with `ucloud-api` (the control plane that mints API keys).

**Triggers**: "ModelVerse", "UModelVerse", `MODELVERSE_API_KEY`, "OpenAI compatible UCloud", any ModelVerse-hosted model name, "调用 ModelVerse", "UCloud 模型市场".

**What's inside**: `scripts/modelverse_call.py` (subcommands `models` / `chat` / `image` / `raw`, streaming-aware), full upstream `api_doc/` mirrored under `references/` (per-model recipes for ~80 text / image / video / audio models, plus error codes and quick-start), and `scripts/update-docs.sh` to refresh `references/` from the upstream internal GitLab.

### Upstream — [anthropics/skills](./anthropics-skills) &nbsp;·&nbsp; [source](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)

Anthropic's official skill collection, vendored as a submodule so we always have the canonical references at hand. The two we lean on most:

#### [→ frontend-design](./anthropics-skills/skills/frontend-design)

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Generates creative, polished code that avoids generic AI aesthetics.

**Triggers**: "build a web component / page / app", "design a landing page", "make this look better", "non-generic UI".

#### [→ skill-creator](./anthropics-skills/skills/skill-creator)

The meta-skill for authoring, improving, and evaluating other skills — drafts SKILL.md, runs evals (with/without baselines), launches an eval viewer, iterates with quantitative + qualitative feedback, then optimizes the description for triggering accuracy.

**Triggers**: "create a new skill", "improve my skill", "run evals on a skill", "optimize a skill description".

> Also available inside `anthropics-skills/skills/`: `claude-api`, `mcp-builder`, `webapp-testing`, `pdf`, `docx`, `xlsx`, `pptx`, `canvas-design`, `theme-factory`, and more — browse the directory and pull what you need.

## Updating a skill

```bash
# bump one skill to its remote HEAD
cd <skill-dir> && git pull origin main && cd ..
git add <skill-dir> && git commit -m "bump <skill> to <sha>"

# or bump everything at once
git submodule update --remote --merge
git commit -am "bump all skills"
```

## Adding a new skill

```bash
git submodule add git@github.com:mfzzf/<new-skill>.git <new-skill>
# then add an entry to the Catalog section above
git commit -am "add <new-skill>"
```

## Skill format

Every skill in this repo follows the Claude Code skill convention: a top-level `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and an optional `references/` folder for progressively-disclosed deeper docs. See [Anthropic's skill-creator guide](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) for the canonical format.
